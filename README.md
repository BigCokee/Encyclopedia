# UoE/DS4D/G14_Encyclopedia
Our project is an interactive projection installation of Encyclopaedia Britannica. Since we got datasets from the National Library of Scotland, and found that it has 8 editions of 195 volumes, which is difficult for people to find information they need. For the sake of enhancing the Encyclopaedia Britannicaâ€™s readability, interactivity and enjoyment, we try to find specific relationships in it and use creative methods to immerse audiences in reading.

The encyclopedia text data analysis is in < ./G14_Encyclopedia_V1-V8_Visualization > (including the pre-preparation description of the function library to be installed)
